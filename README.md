# Use watsonx Granite Model Series, Postgre with DbVector, and LangChain to answer questions (RAG)

Hello everyone in this demo we are going to build a simple program that will connect to a Postgre Server with DB vector and use LangChain to answer questions using RAG.

This notebook contains the steps and code to demonstrate support of Retrieval Augumented Generation in watsonx.ai. It introduces commands for data retrieval, knowledge base building & querying, and model testing.

Some familiarity with Python is helpful. This notebook uses Python 3.10.

### About Retrieval Augmented Generation
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a versatile pattern that can unlock a number of use cases requiring factual recall of information, such as querying a knowledge base in natural language.

In its simplest form, RAG requires 3 steps:

- Index knowledge base passages (once)
- Retrieve relevant passage(s) from knowledge base (for every user query)
- Generate a response by feeding retrieved passage into a large language model (for every user query)

<a id="setup"></a>
##  Set up the environment

Before you use the sample code in this notebook, you must perform the following setup tasks:

-  Create a <a href="https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/ibm-watson-machine-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener no referrer">Watson Machine Learning (WML) Service</a> instance (a free plan is offered and information about how to create the instance can be found <a href="https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/ml-service-instance.html?context=analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener no referrer">here</a>).


### Install and import the dependecies


```python
from IPython.display import clear_output
!pip install "langchain==0.0.345" 
!pip install wget 
!pip install sentence-transformers 
!pip install "chromadb==0.3.26" 
!pip install "ibm-watson-machine-learning>=1.0.335" 
!pip install "pydantic==1.10.0"
!pip install python-dotenv
clear_output()
```


```python
#conda install -c pytorch faiss-cpu=1.7.4 mkl=2021 blas=1.0=mkl
#!pip install langchain[all]
#!pip3 install Langchain[FAISS]
#!pip install faiss-cpu
```

### watsonx API connection
This cell defines the credentials required to work with watsonx API for Foundation
Model inferencing.

Add the IBM Cloud user API key to the .env file. For details, see <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey&interface=ui" target="_blank" rel="noopener no referrer">documentation</a>.



```python
import os, getpass
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
```




```python
project_id = os.getenv("PROJECT_ID", None)
credentials = {
    #"url":  "https://eu-de.ml.cloud.ibm.com",
    "url": "https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com",
    "apikey": os.getenv("API_KEY", None)
}
```

### Defining the project id
The API requires project id that provides the context for the call. We will obtain the id from the project in which this notebook runs. Otherwise, please provide the project id.

**Hint**: You can find the `project_id` as follows. Open the prompt lab in watsonx.ai. At the very top of the UI, there will be `Projects / <project name> /`. Click on the `<project name>` link. Then get the `project_id` from Project's Manage tab (Project -> Manage -> General -> Details).



```python
try:
    project_id = os.environ["PROJECT_ID"]
except KeyError:
    project_id = input("Please enter your project_id (hit enter): ")
```

# Vector stores

A vector store is a system or database that is specifically designed to store and search embedded data using vector representations. It allows users to store unstructured data by converting it into embedding vectors, which capture the semantic meaning and relationships between different data points. At query time, the system can then compare the embedded query to the stored vectors and retrieve the most similar ones. The vector store manages the storage and indexing of the embedded data, as well as the efficient retrieval of relevant results during vector search.

<a id="data"></a>
## Document data loading

Download the file with State of the Union.


```python
import wget
filename = 'state_of_the_union.txt'
url = 'https://raw.github.com/IBM/watson-machine-learning-samples/master/cloud/data/foundation_models/state_of_the_union.txt'
if not os.path.isfile(filename):
    wget.download(url, out=filename)
```

<a id="build_base"></a>
## Build up knowledge base

The most common approach in RAG is to create dense vector representations of the knowledge base in order to calculate the semantic similarity to a given user query.

In this basic example, we take the State of the Union speech content (filename), split it into chunks, embed it using an open-source embedding model,


```python
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
loader = TextLoader(filename ,encoding='utf-8')
documents = loader.load()
```


```python
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
```

The dataset we are using is already split into self-contained passages that can be ingested by Chroma.

### Create an embedding function



```python
from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings()
```

The performance of any vector store db may differ depending on the embedding model used.

There are different vector databases out there like
- Chroma
- FAISS
- lancedb
etc.


## Chroma
Load it into <a href="https://www.trychroma.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener no referrer">Chroma</a>, and then query it.
Note that you can feed a custom embedding function to be used by chromadb. 


```python
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
db_chroma = Chroma.from_documents(texts, embeddings)
```


```python
type(db_chroma)
```


    langchain.vectorstores.chroma.Chroma



##  FAISS
```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
db_faiss = FAISS.from_documents(documents, OpenAIEmbeddings())
```

## Postgre with PgVector

Howeve we want to use a standard database like postgre with the  PgVector feature.
To this demo let us build our Docker container we create a file **docker-compose.yml**
```
services:
  db:
    hostname: db
    image: ankane/pgvector
    ports:
     - 5432:5432
    restart: always
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=vectordb
      - POSTGRES_USER=testuser
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=testpwd
      - POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust
  #  volumes:
      - ./init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql
```
with **init.sql**
    

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS embeddings (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  embedding vector,
  text text,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```
and later just type
```
docker-compose up -d
```

First we need to build the CONNECTION  like:
```python
CONNECTION_STRING = "postgresql+psycopg://user:password@postgresql-server:5432/vectordb"
```


```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
# Load the .env file
load_dotenv()

# Get the values from the .env file
user = "testuser"
password ="testpwd"
database = "vectordb"
#server = "af651cca01b154fe28a0df0167cad5a7-844854289.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com"
server="localhost"
# Construct the connection string
CONNECTION_STRING = f"postgresql+psycopg://{user}:{password}@{server}:5432/{database}"
# Print the connection string
print(CONNECTION_STRING)
```

    postgresql+psycopg://testuser:testpwd@localhost:5432/vectordb



```python
from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFDirectoryLoader
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.embeddings.huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores.pgvector import PGVector
```

#### Document loading from a folder containing PDFs


```python
pdf_folder_path = './rhods-doc'
loader = PyPDFDirectoryLoader(pdf_folder_path)
docs = loader.load()
```

#### Split documents into chunks with some overlap


```python
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1024,
                                               chunk_overlap=40)
all_splits_pdfs = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)
#all_splits[0]
```

#### Cleanup documents as PostgreSQL won't accept the NUL character, '\x00', in TEXT fields.


```python
for doc in all_splits_pdfs:
    doc.page_content = doc.page_content.replace('\x00', '')
```

#### Create the index and ingest the documents


```python
embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings()

COLLECTION_NAME = "documents_test"

db = PGVector.from_documents(
    documents=all_splits_pdfs,
    embedding=embeddings,
    collection_name=COLLECTION_NAME,
    connection_string=CONNECTION_STRING,)
```

<a id="models"></a>
## Foundation Models on `watsonx.ai`

IBM watsonx foundation models are among the <a href="https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/watsonxllm" target="_blank" rel="noopener no referrer">list of LLM models supported by Langchain</a>. This example shows how to communicate with <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-09-28-IBM-Announces-Availability-of-watsonx-Granite-Model-Series,-Client-Protections-for-IBM-watsonx-Models" target="_blank" rel="noopener no referrer">Granite Model Series</a> using <a href="https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener no referrer">Langchain</a>.

### Defining model
You need to specify `model_id` that will be used for inferencing:


```python
from ibm_watson_machine_learning.foundation_models.utils.enums import ModelTypes

model_id = ModelTypes.GRANITE_13B_CHAT_V2
```

### Defining the model parameters
We need to provide a set of model parameters that will influence the result:


```python
from ibm_watson_machine_learning.metanames import GenTextParamsMetaNames as GenParams
from ibm_watson_machine_learning.foundation_models.utils.enums import DecodingMethods

parameters = {
    GenParams.DECODING_METHOD: DecodingMethods.GREEDY,
    GenParams.MIN_NEW_TOKENS: 1,
    GenParams.MAX_NEW_TOKENS: 200,
    GenParams.STOP_SEQUENCES: ["<|endoftext|>"]
}
```

### LangChain CustomLLM wrapper for watsonx model
Initialize the `WatsonxLLM` class from Langchain with defined parameters and `ibm/granite-13b-chat-v2`. 


```python
from langchain.llms import WatsonxLLM

watsonx_granite = WatsonxLLM(
    model_id=model_id.value,
    url=credentials.get("url"),
    apikey=credentials.get("apikey"),
    project_id=project_id,
    params=parameters
)
```

<a id="predict"></a>
## Generate a retrieval-augmented response to a question

Build the `RetrievalQA` (question answering chain) to automate the RAG task.


```python
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA

qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=watsonx_granite, chain_type="stuff", retriever=db.as_retriever())
```

### Select questions

Get questions from the previously loaded test dataset.


```python
query = "What is vector database?"
qa.run(query)
```




    " A vector database is a database that can store vectors (fixed-length lists of numbers) along with other data items. Vector databases typically implement one or more Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms, so that one can search the database with a query vector to retrieve the closest matching database records. Vectors are mathematical representations of data in a high-dimensional space. In this space, each dimension corresponds to a feature of the data, and tens of thousands of dimensions might be used to represent sophisticated data. A vector's position in this space represents its characteristics. Words, phrases, or entire documents, and images, audio, and other types of data can all be vectorized. These feature vectors may be computed from the raw data using machine learning methods such as feature extraction algorithms, word embeddings, or deep learning networks. The goal is that semantically similar data will be represented by similar vectors, allowing for efficient searching and retrieval of data."



## Ingesting new documents

In our exploration of LangChain   Below are some key APIs from LangChain's 
- add_documents(): This function allows us to incorporate additional documents into the vector store.
- add_embeddings(): It enables the addition of more embeddings to the vector store.
- from_documents(): This API returns a VectorStore based on the provided documents.
- from_embeddings(): This function provides aindex generated from the given embeddings.
- similarity_search(): This function retrieves documents that are most similar to a given query.
- similarity_search_by_vector(): It retrieves documents that are most similar to a given embedding.

These APIs form the foundation for combining LangChain's capabilities in general, enabling you to work with embeddings and perform efficient similarity searches within your applications.
